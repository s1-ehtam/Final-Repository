Other members of this family include D-lactate dehydrogenase, this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of D-lactate to pyruvate using FAD as a co-factor; mitomycin radical oxidase, this enzyme oxidizes the reduced form of mitomycins and is involved in mitomycin resistance. This family includes MurB an UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase enzyme EC:1.1.1.158. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.

This family consists of various enzymes that use FAD as a co-factor, most of the enzymes are similar to oxygen oxidoreductase. One of the enzymes Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) has a solved structure, the alignment includes the FAD binding site, called the PP-loop, between residues 99-110.
